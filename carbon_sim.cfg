# The directory where this file is placed is dynamically generated.
#   The default location is ./results/$(DATE)/

# You can use OUTPUT_DIR=<directory> to place the output of the simulation
#   in a specific directory
#   e.g., make radix_bench_test OUTPUT_DIR=radix
#   will place the output in the directory ./results/radix/
# Also, ./results/latest/ is a symbolic link that points to the
#   output directory of the most recently started simulation
# Each output directory, in addition to the output_file also contains
#   (a) the configuration file used ('carbon_sim.cfg')
#   (b) the command used to run the simulation ('command')
#   (c) log files that are produced ('*.log')
# To remove output directories, do make clean_output_dirs

#   directories of the form ./results/$(DATE)/ and the symbolic link
